## At Mozilla, we believe that privacy is fundamental to a healthy internet.

That’s why we build Firefox Lite, and all our products, to give you greater control over the information you share online and the information you share with us. We strive to collect only what we need to improve Lite for everyone.

In this Privacy Notice, we explain what data Lite shares and point you to settings to share even less. We also adhere to the practices outlined in the Mozilla [privacy policy](https://www.mozilla.org/privacy/) for how we receive, handle and share information we collect from Lite.

## Firefox Lite by default shares data to:

### Improve performance and stability for users everywhere

* __Interaction data__: Lite sends data about your interactions with Lite to us (number of webpages visited; and session length) and Lite features offered by Mozilla or our partners (such as interaction with Lite search features and search partner referrals).

* __Technical data__: Lite sends data about your Lite version and language; device operating system and hardware configuration; memory, basic information about crashes and errors; outcome of automated processes like updates, and activation to us. When Lite sends data to us, your IP address is temporarily collected as part of our server logs.

Read detailed documentation for Lite [here](https://github.com/mozilla-tw/Lite/wiki/Telemetry) or turn off “Send Usage Data” in your Settings.

### Suggest relevant content

Lite displays content, such as Top Sites (websites suggested by Mozilla for first-time Lite users).

* __Technical & Interaction data__: Lite sends us data such as the position, size and placement of content we suggest, as well as basic data about your interactions with Lite's suggested content. This includes the number of times suggested content is displayed or clicked.

### Measure and support our marketing

* __Referral and Campaign Data__: To help improve our marketing campaigns, Lite may use “Referral Data” such as the website domain or advertising campaign that referred you to download and install Lite. This data is kept by our analytics vendor and provided when you start Lite, and also includes a Google advertising ID, timestamp, country, locale, operating system, and app version.  We may also use third party vendors to manage referral programs and handle any data that you choose to submit.

### Improve our product based on your feedback

To help us improve performance, support crashes, understand your experience with Lite and improve the user experience through A/B testing and in-product messaging, Firefox Lite uses Google’s Firebase platform, which receives data from your device.

## If you use these features, Lite will share data to provide functionality: {: #optional-features }

### Search

You can perform searches directly from the search bar in Lite. _Mozilla does not receive your search queries._ Query data is sent to your search provider, which has its own privacy policy.

* __Search Suggestions__: Lite by default sends search queries to your search provider to help you discover common phrases other people have searched for and improve your search experience. These data will not be sent if your selected search provider does not support search suggestions.

### Location {: #location-services }

* __Location data to Google's geolocation service__: Lite always asks before determining and sharing your location with a requesting website (for example, if a map website needs your location to provide directions). To determine location, Lite may use your operating system’s geolocation features, Wi-fi networks, cell phone towers, or IP address, and may send this data to Google's geolocation service, which has its own [privacy policy](https://www.google.com/privacy/lsf.html).
