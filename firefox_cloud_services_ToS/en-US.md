## Summary

This top section summarizes the terms below. This summary is provided to help your understanding of the terms, but be sure to read the entire document, because when you agree to it, you are indicating you accept all of the terms, not just this summary.

* Firefox cloud services (the "Services") are a suite of services provided to you by Mozilla.
* The Services are provided "as is" and there are no warranties of any kind. There are significant limits on Mozilla's liability for any damages arising from your use of the Services.

## Terms of Service

1. #### Introduction

    These Terms of Service ("<u>Terms</u>") govern your use of Firefox cloud services, a suite of online services provided by Mozilla (the "Services").

2. #### Firefox Accounts

    In order to use some of the Services, you'll need to create a Firefox Account.  During registration, you will be asked to set a password. You are responsible for keeping your password confidential and for the activity that happens through your Firefox account. Mozilla is not responsible for any losses arising out of unauthorized use of your Firefox account.
    
    “Join Firefox” is an offering available in some countries to better experience the Firefox family of products as well as practical privacy and security knowledge.

3. #### Services

    (a) Firefox Screenshots allows you to capture webpage content that can be viewed later by you or others. 
    
    (b) Firefox Lockwise lets you access passwords saved to Firefox across devices.  A Firefox Account is required. 

    (c) Firefox Monitor is an informational service to promote online security by informing you of public data breaches.   You can scan email addresses on our website to see most publicly known breaches. If you subscribe with a Firefox Account, you will receive: 

    * Full Report: This includes a complete list of publicly known hacks, including breaches of sensitive websites, such as those for children or adult and dating sites (these sites are excluded from website scans in order to protect the privacy of those individuals). 
    * Breach Alerts: This notifies you if your email address appears in a new data breach. 
    * Safety Tips: This sends you occasional online safety tips from Mozilla.

    It is your responsibility to protect your online accounts using strong and different passwords, security questions, two-factor authentication, password managers, and other safety measures. Although Firefox Monitor and [Have I Been Pwned?](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) strive to have current data, there is no guarantee that either will have complete or timely records of all public data breaches. 

    (d) Firefox Notes lets you take notes in Firefox.  A Firefox Account is required to view, edit, and delete your Notes across devices.  

    (e) Firefox Send lets you share encrypted files that automatically expire.  A Firefox Account is required for large file sizes. 

    (f) Firefox Sync lets you access information stored in Firefox across devices, including your tabs, awesome bar, passwords, bookmarks, and browser preferences. You can enable and disable Firefox Sync through the Tools section of Firefox.  A Firefox Account is required. 
    
    (g) Firefox Private Network is a proxy service that helps you browse more privately by placing an intermediary between your Firefox browser and the internet to obfuscate your IP address. A Firefox Account is required.

4. #### Privacy Policy

    We use the information we receive through the Services as described in our [Mozilla Privacy Policy](https://www.mozilla.org/privacy/). Our Privacy Notices describe in more detail the data we receive from each service:

    You can change your email subscriptions with Mozilla from our emails (click the link at the bottom) or from the browser (visit Firefox / Preferences / Sync / Manage Account / Email Preferences).

8. #### Term; Termination

    These Terms will continue to apply until ended by either you or Mozilla. You can choose to end them at any time for any reason by deleting your Firefox account, discontinuing your use of the Services, and if applicable, unsubscribing from our emails.  

    We may suspend or terminate your access to the Services at any time for any reason, including, but not limited to, if we reasonably believe: (i) you have violated these Terms, (ii) you create risk or possible legal exposure for us; or (iii) our provision of the Services to you is no longer commercially viable. We will make reasonable efforts to notify you by the email address associated with your Firefox account or the next time you attempt to access the Services.

    In all such cases, these Terms shall terminate, including, without limitation, your license to use the Services, except that the following sections shall continue to apply: Indemnification, Disclaimer; Limitation of Liability, Miscellaneous.

9. #### Indemnification

    You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Mozilla, its contractors, contributors, licensors, and partners, and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents ("Indemnified Parties") from and against any and all third party claims and expenses, including attorneys' fees, arising out of or related to your use of the Services  (including, but not limited to, from any content uploaded by you).

YOU BEAR THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO SELECTING THE SERVICES FOR YOUR PURPOSES AND AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE RISK THAT YOUR CONTENT IS DELETED OR CORRUPTED OR THAT SOMEONE ELSE ACCESSES YOUR ONLINE ACCOUNTS. THIS LIMITATION WILL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR SPECIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

    Mozilla may update these Terms from time to time to address a new feature of the Services or to clarify a provision. The updated Terms will be posted online. If the changes are substantive, we will announce the update through Mozilla's usual channels for such announcements such as blog posts and forums. Your continued use of the Services after the effective date of such changes constitutes your acceptance of such changes.
