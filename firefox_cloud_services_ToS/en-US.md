This top section summarizes the terms below. This summary is provided to help your understanding of the terms, but be sure to read the entire document, because when you agree to it, you are indicating you accept all of the terms, not just this summary.

- Firefox cloud services (the "Services") are a suite of services provided to you by Mozilla.

#### Terms of Service

1. #### Introduction

    These Terms of Service ("<u>Terms</u>") govern your use of Firefox cloud services, a suite of online services provided by Mozilla (the "Services").

2. #### Firefox Accounts

    In order to use the Services, you'll need to create a Firefox Account.  During registration, you will be asked to set a password. You are responsible for keeping your password confidential and for the activity that happens through your Firefox account. Mozilla is not responsible for any losses arising out of unauthorized use of your Firefox account.

3. #### Features

    Firefox Sync lets you access information stored in Firefox across devices, including your tabs, awesome bar, passwords, bookmarks, and browser preferences. You can enable and disable Firefox Sync through the Tools section of Firefox.
    
    Find My Device allows you to remotely locate and control certain features of a Firefox OS device, such as viewing recent locations, erasing local content, enabling the ringtone or lock-screen, or displaying a message. To use these functions, you must enable Find My Device in the settings of your device.  Find My Device will work even if the sound and location settings on your device are silent or turned off. You can disable this feature in the settings of your device.
    
    If your device is misplaced, you can log into https://find.firefox.com using your Firefox Account credentials to locate and remotely control your device. Your device’s approximate location will be reported to us while the device is turned on and connected to the Internet.  If applicable, you are responsible for any charges associated with data transmittal. If you believe your device was stolen, you should contact law enforcement. Be careful sharing personal information because messages displayed on your device are publicly available.

4. #### Privacy Policy

    The [Firefox Cloud Services Privacy Notice](https://www.mozilla.org/privacy/firefox-cloud/) describes details on what we receive from your use of the Services and how we use that information.

5. #### Your Content in our Services

    You may upload content as part of the features of the Services. By uploading content, you hereby grant us a nonexclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license to use your content in connection with the provision of the Services.

The Services are distributed under and subject to the current version of the [Mozilla Public License](https://www.mozilla.org/MPL/).

7. #### Term; Termination

    These Terms will continue to apply until ended by either you or Mozilla. You can choose to end them at any time for any reason by deactivating your Firefox account and discontinuing your use of the Services.

    We may suspend or terminate your access to the Services at any time for any reason, including, but not limited to, if we reasonably believe: (i) you have violated these Terms, (ii) you create risk or possible legal exposure for us; or (iii) our provision of the Services to you is no longer commercially viable. We will make reasonable efforts to notify you by the email address associated with your Firefox account or the next time you attempt to access the Services.

    In all such cases, these Terms shall terminate, including, without limitation, your license to use the Services, except that the following sections shall continue to apply: Indemnification, Disclaimer; Limitation of Liability, Miscellaneous.

8. #### Indemnification

9. #### Disclaimer; Limitation of Liability

    THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITH ALL FAULTS. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, MOZILLA AND THE INDEMNIFIED PARTIES HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION WARRANTIES THAT THE SERVICES ARE FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGING.

THIS LIMITATION WILL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
