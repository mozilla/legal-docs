7. #### Term; Termination

    These Terms will continue to apply until ended by either you or Mozilla. You can choose to end them at any time for any reason by deactivating your Firefox account and discontinuing your use of the Services.

    We may suspend or terminate your access to the Services at any time for any reason, including, but not limited to, if we reasonably believe: (i) you have violated these Terms, (ii) you create risk or possible legal exposure for us; or (iii) our provision of the Services to you is no longer commercially viable. We will make reasonable efforts to notify you by the email address associated with your Firefox account or the next time you attempt to access the Services.
