# Firefox Reality Privacy Notice

Version 1.1, effective July 23, 2019
{: datetime="2019-07-23" }

## At Mozilla, we believe that privacy is fundamental to a healthy internet.

That’s why we build Firefox Reality, and all our products, to give you greater control over the information you share online and the information you share with us. We strive to collect only what we need to improve Firefox Reality for everyone.

In this Privacy Notice, we explain what data Firefox Reality shares and point you to settings to share even less. We also adhere to the practices outlined in the Mozilla [privacy policy](https://www.mozilla.org/privacy/) for how we receive, handle and share information we collect from Firefox Reality.

## Firefox Reality by default shares data for:

### Improving performance and stability {: #health-report } 

* **Interaction data:** Firefox Reality sends data about your interactions with Firefox Reality to us (such as number of open windows; number of webpages visited; information about voice searches, and session length) and Firefox Reality features offered by Mozilla or our partners (such as interaction with Firefox Reality search features and search partner referrals).

* **Technical data:** Firefox Reality sends data about your Firefox Reality version and language; device operating system and hardware configuration, including VR headset and handsets; memory, basic information about crashes and errors; outcome of automated processes like updates, and activation to us. When Firefox Reality sends data to us, your IP address is temporarily collected as part of our server logs.

### Voice Search {: #voice }

* **Voice Recordings:** When you choose to use voice input for Firefox Reality, your voice recordings are sent to Mozilla and Google’s Cloud Speech service for processing to provide you with suggested text. Mozilla does not keep your recordings.

### Crash reports {: #crash-reporter }

If you turn crash reporting on Mozilla will receive a report with more information if Firefox Reality crashes. Generally, crash reports include:

* **Device information:** This tells us information about your device, such as the operating system, manufacturer and graphics adapter when the crash happened.

* **Application information:** This tells us information about the application that crashed, such as the version, build and build architecture of Firefox Reality you were using.

* **Crash information:** This provides information about the crash, including a report of Firefox Reality’s subroutines at the time of the crash, and a whether a crash happened before Firefox Reality finished starting up, what type of process caused the crash and the information in device memory at the time of the crash.
