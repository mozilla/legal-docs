# Formulaic Content Policies

Last Updated March 20, 2024
{: datetime="2024-03-20" }

We may moderate content shared on the Formulaic platform, to maintain a healthy community and a minimum quality standard. Our moderation will be based on the following rules.

## 1. Misleading or inaccurate descriptions

Formulas submitted to Formulaic must be accompanied by a brief description. That description should be written in plain language, and should be sufficient for a viewer to understand what function the Formula is intended to facilitate. Subjective value-based terms (e.g. “high quality,” “unique,” “holistic”) will generally not be deemed misleading. 

Under this policy, Mozilla may delete:

- Formula descriptions that appear likely to mislead or confuse the average user;
- Formulas that, more often than not, produce results unrelated to the topic described; or
- Formulas that direct people to a specific third-party website or service not expressly mentioned in the description.

Users may be suspended or banned for repeatedly posting misleading or inaccurate content.

## 2. Non-functional or erroneous Formulas

Mozilla cares about ensuring that the content shared on this site remains high-quality, and usable for its intended purpose. Formulas that contain errors, that do not work in the applicable generative AI tools, that cause technical bugs or errors, or that create security concerns will be deleted. In some cases, we may allow the user an opportunity to correct the problem before deletion.

## 3. Copyright

### How to submit a copyright notice

Mozilla will respond to takedown requests that comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). If you believe that content shared on Formulaic infringes a copyright that is owned by you or by someone that you legally represent, you may submit a takedown notice, using the procedures outlined on [Mozilla’s copyright page](https://www.mozilla.org/about/legal/report-infringement/). 

Filing a DMCA notice will commence a structured process. Your complaint will be reviewed for accuracy, validity, and completeness. If any of the required DMCA elements are missing, we will be unable to process your takedown request. If your complaint appears to satisfy the requirements and we remove the material in question, we will notify the affected user, and provide them with a copy of your complaint (which may include any personal information that you included there). If you do not wish to have your information shared, you may wish to consider having an agent submit the complaint on your behalf. We will also provide the user with information about how to file a counter-notice.

If we remove material from the Mozilla site in response to your infringement notice, you will receive confirmation that the material has been removed. If we decide not to act on your infringement report, you also will receive a notification of that decision.

Mozilla has a policy to terminate access for accounts that are repeat infringers.

### What can I do if I think my content should not have been removed?

If something you shared was removed due to a mistake or misidentification by the copyright owner, you can file a DMCA counter-notice, using the process described on [Mozilla’s copyright page](https://www.mozilla.org/about/legal/report-infringement/).

## 4. Trademark

### How to notify us of trademark infringement

A trademark is a word, name, logo, brand, catchphrase, or similar device used to identify the goods or services provided by a specific rightsholder. Users on our platform may not use a third party’s trademark in a way that is likely to confuse or mislead others about your (or a third party’s) affiliation with the trademark owner.

Referencing or discussing a third party’s trademark may not, on its own, violate this policy. Mozilla will not remove a prompt for using a trademark to accurately identify something, or where an exception to trademark law, such as fair use, applies.

If you are a trademark owner or a trademark owner’s authorized agent, and you believe that content shared on the Formulaic app infringes one or more of your trademarks, please send us a “Trademark Notice.”  We handle Trademark Notices similarly to how we handle notices of copyright infringement, and require that they contain each of the following items:

- A physical or electronic signature from the trademark owner or its authorized representative;
- Identification of the word, name, logo, brand, catchphrase, or other mark that you claim has been infringed;
- Sufficient information to allow us to determine the location of the infringement (for example, the URL where the infringing material is located, or the portion of a particular image that contains the infringed mark);
- Your name, address, telephone number, and an email address where you can be reached;
- A statement that you have a good faith belief that the use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the trademark owner; and
- A statement that the information in your Trademark Notice is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are the trademark owner or are authorized to act on the owner’s behalf.

Mozilla has a policy of terminating access for repeated trademark infringement.

### What can I do if my post was removed for trademark infringement?

If material that you posted was removed for trademark infringement, and you believe that it did not infringe, you can file a counter-notice to contest the removal of that content. If you wish to file a counter-notice, you can submit one at the following address: [dmcanotice@mozilla.com](mailto:dmcanotice@mozilla.com). Trademark counter-notices must contain the same elements that are required for copyright counter-notices, as described on Mozilla’s copyright page.

## 5. Impersonation

Users should be able to trust that the person or organization indicated by another account’s name or profile is authentic, and genuinely represents the account’s owner. You may not impersonate others, and may not share content in a way that is likely to confuse people regarding the materials’ source. Violations of this policy may include posing as an authorized representative of a particular person or business, or displaying counterfeit identities. 

If you discover an account that you believe is impersonating, or purporting to represent another person or entity without authorization, you can report that account to us. Please identify the specific account in question, as well as the account, individual, or entity that you believe is being impersonated without authorization.

If further information is likely to help clarify your concerns (for example, if the impersonation was done in a specific post), please also share those details. You will also be asked to provide your contact information, so that we can contact you with further questions, and with updates on your complaint. For more information about how we store your information, see the Mozilla.social Privacy Policy.

## 6. Violent content 

Users may not use the platform to glorify or promote violence. Mozilla will remove accounts owned by the perpetrators of violent or terrorist acts (explained more in our policy on terrorism and violent organizations), as well as content that appears intended to coordinate, incite, encourage, facilitate or celebrate violence against any individuals, groups, or entities. Account owners that share such content will be suspended, unless the content appears to have been shared inadvertently, or to promote awareness or commentary.

Mozilla will remove content that includes, or appears intended to result in the creation of excessively violent content, including content that is related to the abuse of humans or animals. However, it may make exceptions for content that relates to pressing social or political concerns (e.g. a Formula intended to create images of a warzone). When it does make such exceptions, Mozilla may take steps to limit the reach of such content, or may apply a warning label.

Users also may not use the platform to advocate for, or to attempt to encourage or enable others to commit violent acts. We will remove, and encourage users to report, content indicating a user or third party’s intent to cause real-world injuries to others. Where we believe there is a serious risk of harm to individuals or to public safety, we may also report such content to law enforcement, and will work with law enforcement agencies as necessary to investigate and address the threat. 

## 7. Self-Harm

Users may not use the platform to glorify or promote self-harm. This includes deliberate self-harm, such as suicide, cutting, ingesting dangerous substances, and similar activities. It also includes promotion of content that is inherently harmful, such as content that encourages or fosters eating disorders and body dysmorphia. 

Items that would be prohibited by this policy might include:

- A Formula to create a suicide note;
- A Formula to create and glorify excessively or unrealistically skinny people; or
- A Formula to create an extreme or unhealthy diet plan.

## 8. Sexualized content

Mozilla will remove any and all content that involves, or that facilitates the creation of pornographic content, or of overtly sexual images of specific individuals, or of materials that depict or promote sexual violence. It will also remove any and all content that involves, encourages, or facilitates the sexualization and sexual abuse of minors — whether real or imaginary. When such content is discovered, Mozilla may suspend the offending account, and where appropriate, will report such content to law enforcement or NCMEC.

This rule does not restrict Formulas that facilitate the creation of content involving non-explicit nudity or sexuality. Similarly, Formulas that may allow users to create pornographic content, but that are equally likely to be used for other types of content, are not restricted under this rule. 

## 9. Misinformation

Mozilla is concerned about the use of AI to develop and spread misinformation and disinformation, which threaten the fabric of a healthy democratic society.

Mozilla does not allow content that (a) facilitates or appears intended to facilitate the creation or spread of misleading or demonstrably false information or conspiracy theories, and (b) is likely to radicalize others or to encourage discrimination, prejudice, or political and social violence. Such content will be removed, and the accounts that shared them may be suspended (depending on the seriousness of the violation and whether the violation has occurred in the past).

## 10. Promotion of illegal goods

Users may not use Mozilla’s platform to traffic in, access, or share information about how to manufacture or disseminate illegal or legally-restricted goods and services. A non-exhaustive list of such goods and services includes 

(a) Weapons, firearms, ammunitions, explosives;
(b) Medications, drugs, and controlled substances, including cigarettes, marijuana, and alcohol;
(c) Sexual services;
(d) Products made from endangered animals;
(e) Human blood, organs, body parts, or skeletal remains;
(f) Services that involve trafficking in, trading, or enslaving human beings

Content that violates this rule will be deleted, and accounts that share such items may be suspended, and in extreme cases, information may be shared with law enforcement. 

## 11. Fraud/Counterfeit goods

Mozilla does not permit content that is intended to facilitate deception or defrauding of third parties. This policy prohibits (among other things) the creation of templates for mass emails related to multi-level marketing, phishing, and related schemes.

Violations will be removed, and accounts that share such content may be suspended.

## 12. Terrorist and Violent Extremist Content

Content intended to support the glorification or promotion of terrorist or extremist organizations, ideologies or activities are prohibited, and will be removed when they are discovered. Content that falls under this policy may include template manifestos, action plans, public statements, as well as content intended to facilitate the creation of weapons, explosives, and other dangerous materials, or the gathering of information related to public utilities, public health, government, or other services. Mozilla will remove this content, and may share information with government and law enforcement agencies about the accounts that shared it.

## 13. Hate Speech

Mozilla will remove content that contains derogatory and/or hateful language about any protected group or class, as well as content that appears intended to single out such groups for mistreatment or abuse, or to disseminate hatred or stereotypes.

Accounts that violate this policy repeatedly, or who violate it in an egregious manner, will be suspended.
