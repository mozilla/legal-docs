# Firefox Relay Terms of Service

Version 1.4, effective Sept 16, 2022
{: datetime="2022-09-16" }

Firefox Relay (the “Service”) allows you to keep your primary email address safe and private from online services by making unique, alias email addresses that allow you to send and receive emails without revealing your primary email address.

Please read these Terms of Service carefully because they explain important information about your use of the Service.

## You’ll Need A Firefox Account

A Firefox Account is required to use the Service. To create a Firefox Account, you will also need to agree to the [Terms of Service](https://www.mozilla.org/about/legal/terms/services/) and [Privacy Notice](https://www.mozilla.org/privacy/firefox/) for your Firefox Account.

## Your Privacy

__Your Privacy.__ The Firefox Relay [Privacy Notice](https://www.mozilla.org/privacy/firefox-relay/) explains what information is sent when you use the Service and how we handle and share that information.

## Permissions Necessary to Provide the Service

__Your Use of the Service.__ Mozilla gives you permission to use Firefox Relay according to these Terms of Service. This permission is only for your personal use. You may not transfer, sublicense, resell, or commercially exploit the Service. You also agree that your use of the Service will comply with Mozilla’s [Conditions of Use](https://www.mozilla.org/about/legal/acceptable-use/). You are solely responsible for the Content you transmit and the consequences.

You give Mozilla all rights necessary to operate the Service, including processing your email addresses, the aliases and alias labels you create and the emails you send and receive through the Service. We do not read or store the content of any of your messages. In the event that an email cannot be delivered to you, we will keep it on our servers and delete it after it has been delivered (in no event will we hold onto it for more than three days). If you use the feature to block promotional emails, the Service will check email headers to determine whether the email should be blocked. 

The Service will only send email attachments up to 10 megabytes. Larger emails are deleted. 

To learn more about how the Service works, you can see Mozilla’s [source code](https://github.com/mozilla/fx-private-relay).

__Your Feedback and Suggestions.__ If you give Mozilla any ideas, suggestions, or feedback about Firefox Relay or the services you use with the Firefox Relay, you give Mozilla permission to use them for free and without any additional obligations.

__Mozilla’s Intellectual Property.__ Neither Mozilla nor its licensors grant you any intellectual property rights in the Service that are not specifically stated in these Terms. For example, these Terms do not provide the right to use any copyrights, trademarks, or other distinctive brand features of Mozilla or its licensors. The Mozilla software is distributed under and subject to the current version of the Mozilla Public License, or other similarly permissive licenses.

## Your Payment

We offer Firefox Relay as either a free service or a paid subscription service.

__Alias Limit and Customization.__ With the free service, you can create up to 5 random email aliases. With the paid subscription, you can create an unlimited number of aliases and you have the option to create a custom subdomain.

__Payment.__ We offer Firefox Relay as an automatically renewing subscription service. When you sign up, you authorize us to charge the payment method you provide for the subscription fees for the first term of the Service. Your plan renews automatically at the end of each term, and you authorize us to charge the subscription fees each term. If you stop paying, we will immediately suspend your account, and we may delete it after 2 months of not paying.

__30-Day Refund Policy.__ The first time you subscribe to Firefox Relay through Mozilla's website, if you cancel your account within the first 30 days, you may request a refund and Mozilla will refund your first subscription term. This offer only applies the first time you subscribe. This is in addition to any rights you may have under your country’s consumer laws.

## You May Cancel Your Subscription at Any Time

__Cancellation.__ You may cancel your subscription to Firefox Relay at any time by deactivating your account and cancelling your subscription. You can do this by clicking the “Cancel Subscription” link in any email that we send you or by going to the Subscriptions & Payments section of your Firefox Account and clicking “Cancel.” If you choose to cancel, auto-renewal will stop, we will not charge you for any future payment periods, and you will lose access to the service at the end of the current billing cycle.

## You Are Responsible For the Consequences of Your Use of the Service

* You assure Mozilla that you will not use the Service to infringe anyone’s rights or violate any law.

* To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree that Mozilla will not be liable in any way for any inability to use the Service, for any limitations of the service, or for any claim arising out of these terms. Mozilla specifically disclaims the following: Indirect, special, incidental, consequential, or exemplary damages, direct or indirect damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, lost profits, loss of data, or computer malfunction. Any liability for Mozilla under this agreement is limited to $500.

* You agree to indemnify and hold Mozilla harmless for any liability or claim that results from your participation in Firefox Relay, to the extent permitted by applicable law.

* Mozilla provides the service “as is.” To the extent permitted by applicable law, Mozilla specifically disclaims any legal guarantees or warranties such as “merchantability,” “fitness for a particular purpose,” “non-infringement,” and warranties arising out of a course of dealing, usage, or trade.

* You may have other rights under your own country’s laws. Nothing in these Terms of Service is intended to affect those rights, if they apply.

## Updating or Ending These Terms

* __Mozilla Can Update These Terms.__ Every once in a while, Mozilla may decide to update these Terms. We will post the updated Terms online. We will take your continued use of the Service as acceptance of such changes. We will post an effective date at the top of this page to make it clear when we made our most recent update.

* __Termination.__ These Terms apply until either you or Mozilla decide to end them. You can choose to end them at any time for any reason by stopping your use of the Service and deleting the Firefox Relay Add-on. Mozilla can suspend or end anyone’s access to the Service at any time for any reason, including if Mozilla decides to end the Service. If we decide to suspend or end your access, we will try to notify you at the email address associated with your account or the next time you attempt to access your Account.

  If we terminate your access to the Service without specific cause, you will continue to have access to the Service for the current billing period or we will refund the current month. However, we reserve the right to terminate your use of the Service immediately if we reasonably believe you have violated the Conditions of Use, or have otherwise violated these Terms.

* __Choice of Law.__ California law applies to this contract, except for California’s conflict of law. If there is any conflict between this English version of the contract and a translation, this English version applies.
