# Firefox Focus and Firefox Klar Privacy Notice

Effective April 22, 2025
{: datetime="2025-04-22" }

## At Mozilla, we believe that privacy is fundamental to a healthy internet

That’s why we build Firefox Focus and Klar, and all our products, to give you greater control over the information you share online and the information you share with us. In this Privacy Notice, we explain what data we process, how we process it, and for what purposes. Then, we explain how you can exercise choices about how we process your information.

## Full Privacy Notice for Firefox Focus and Klar

### Mozilla processes your data to:

#### Provide you with the Firefox Focus and Klar browser

Focus and Klar process technical and settings data, as well as browsing history, web form data, temporary internet files, and cookies **on your device** to provide the core functionality of the browser, distinguish your device from others, remember and respect your settings. This means the data stays on your device unless it says otherwise in this Notice. Your browsing data is cleared from your device whenever you close your browser.

Additionally, if you choose to allow it, your precise location may be processed for location-related functionality for websites like Google Maps; this data is only accessed from your device by the website(s) you choose to enable it for —— it is not sent to Mozilla's servers. You can tap the trash can icon in the toolbar at any time to delete your browsing data or update your [location permissions](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/does-firefox-share-my-location-websites) at any time.

#### Provide and improve search functionality

When you perform a search, your search query, device information and location data will be processed by your default search engine (according to their [applicable Privacy Notice](#privacy-notices-for-search-providers)) to provide your search results. You can also choose to enable your default search engine to provide search suggestions.

#### Maintain and improve performance and stability

If Focus or Klar (on Android) encounters an unexpected issue, the [Mozilla Crash Reporter](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/how-send-crash-report-firefox-android) will ask if you wish to send us information, which may include sites that were open at the time of the crash and other browsing data. On iOS, crash reports contain less information and are sent automatically by default; you can [change your iOS settings](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/ios-crash-reports-pref) at any time.

#### Improve security

We use [Google’s Safe Browsing Service](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/how-does-phishing-and-malware-protection-work) to protect you from malicious downloads and phishing attacks, and validate webpage and technical data with [Certificate Authorities](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/secure-website-certificate).

For [some users](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/firefox-dns-over-https), Focus and Klar route DNS requests to a resolver service that has agreed to Mozilla’s [strict privacy standards for resolvers](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/DOH-resolver-policy). This provides added protection from privacy leaks to local networks and also from certain DNS security attacks. System logs of your DNS requests are deleted from the service within 24 hours and are only used for the purpose of DNS resolution. [Learn more](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/firefox-dns-over-https#w_switching-providers) about DNS over HTTPS.

#### Understand usage of Firefox Focus

We collect a minimal amount of technical and interaction data in order to understand how many daily active users Focus has. For a technical overview of the data collected in this daily usage ping, see more detail for [Focus on Android](https://dictionary.telemetry.mozilla.org/apps/focus_android) and [Focus on iOS](https://dictionary.telemetry.mozilla.org/apps/focus_ios). This data is retained for no more than 25 months, and you can opt out of sending the Daily Usage Ping in your [data collection settings](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/usage-ping-settings) at any time. Klar does not collect data on daily active users.
