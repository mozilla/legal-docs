# Formulaic Privacy Notice

Last Updated March 8, 2024
{: datetime="2024-03-08" }

This privacy notice applies to Formulaic, a service that allows users to query, create, share, and manage templates for querying artificial intelligence (AI) based large language models (LLMs) (the “Service”). The Service is owned, licensed, and operated by Mozilla Corporation (referred to herein as “we,” “us,” “our,” or “Mozilla”).  

This privacy notice explains what information Formulaic collects, shares, and processes, and why. We also adhere to the [Mozilla Privacy Policy](https://www.mozilla.org/privacy/) when we receive, handle, and share personal information. Your use of the Service constitutes your acceptance of this privacy notice, which incorporates by reference our Terms of Service.

## Things you should know

We collect the following information directly from you when you use the Service:

**Username.** This is a unique, public-facing account name chosen by you. Any content that you choose to publish on the Formulaic website or otherwise contribute to the Service will include this username. We use this username to attribute you with any content you contribute or publish when using the Service, as well as to enforce our Content Policies.

**Account information.** We may collect personal information, such as your name, username, contact information, and any other information that you provide to us in connection with the creation or administration of your account.

**Formulas, Inputs and Outputs.** There are currently no LLM or similar AI-based platforms operated by or affiliated with Mozilla. However, the Service allows you to query selected LLMs offered by third parties (“Third-Party Models”) by inputting information into templates (“Formulas”) made available by the Service, as well as any Formulas that you yourself may choose to create and/or contribute to the Service. We process the content of your queries, as well as any amendments or updates you make to them, and any other content (including any media) you choose to upload to the Service (“Inputs”) in order to run them through Third-Party Models and generate results (“Outputs”). While we do not store any of this information, you can choose to export your Outputs to your computer. If you abandon a query or navigate away from our site, all Inputs and Outputs will be discarded by your browser and irretrievably lost.

**Dashboard.** The Service also allows you to save your favorite Formulas, draft Formulas, and any published Formulas that you yourself may contribute via a non-public dashboard. We use any data that you provide via the Dashboard to deliver and improve your experience of the Service.

**Reports of violations.** The Service allows you to report suspected violations of our Terms of Service and Content Policies, which are in turn reviewed by human moderators. If you contact us to Report a Violation, we will retain any personal information you may share with us for as long as we need to review, adjudicate, and resolve the case, or as otherwise required by law.

**Communications.** When you contact us in connection with the Service, we may also collect personal information, such as your username, name, email address, or phone number, as well as any other personal information you may provide to us.

We also *automatically* receive certain information when you interact with the Service:

**Technical data.** We receive basic telemetry data by default, which we use to improve the performance, stability, and security of the Service, including information about your device, including hardware configuration and device operating system; browser information, such as browser type and settings; log files and usage data; and event information, such as errors or crashes. We may also receive additional information about your device, such as country, language, operator and OEM, which we use to prevent fraud and abuse, enforce our terms, and improve the security of the Service.

**Location data.** Your IP address is temporarily collected as part of our server logs, and automatically deleted after 30 days. We use it to approximate your location to comply with relevant legal and regulatory requirements, as well as for fraud and abuse prevention purposes.

**Interaction data.** We receive aggregate data about visits to the Formulaic website and other aggregate insights about user interactions with the Service. We use this data to better understand usage of the Service, as well as to add, improve, or remove certain features of the Service. We may also receive HTTP referral data to understand the website or domain that referred you to our site, which we only use for purposes of addressing bugs or other technical issues with our Service. We automatically delete this data after 30 days.

**Metrics.** We may also use cookies, device information, and IP addresses, along with clear GIFs, cookies, and third party services to securely operate the Service, help us understand how users engage with our Service, such as visits to our site and settings preferences, and provide additional functionality. We use:

- Sign in with Google, which places a cookie on your device to assist with sign-in and authentication to the Service. When you sign in to the Service, you accept the associated [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and [Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms) from Google.
- Google Analytics to obtain metrics on how users engage with our websites. This helps us to improve site content. For more information about how Google uses your personal information, please visit [Google Analytics’ Privacy & Security](support.google.com/analytics/topic/2919631?ref_topic=1008008). You can install the [Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) to prevent data collection about your visits to the Service and prohibit data transmission to Google Analytics.

We also receive the following *information from third parties* when you use the Service:

**Account data.** You need a Google Account in order to create an account and access the Service. When you log in with your Google Account to access the Service, we receive your name, email address, language preference, and profile picture from Google, and use this information to assist with your account administration and to contact you in relation to the Service, as well as to enforce our Terms of Service and Content Policies. Use of a Google Account is governed by [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and [Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms).

**Fraud Prevention.** We use third-party technology, Google’s Invisible reCAPTCHA, in the background of our website in order to identify fraudulent activity. Use of the Invisible reCAPTCHA is governed by Google's [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and [Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms).

**Model query data.** When you use the Service to query Third-Party Models, we automatically receive a payload back that contains the contents of your query; information about the model queried (such as the name and version number); information about technical problems with processing the query, if any; the number of tokens required to process the query; and the model Outputs in response to the query. We do not store this data beyond temporarily caching it to process your query and return the Outputs to you.

**Reports of violations.** The Service also allows users to report suspected violations of our Content Policies, which are reviewed by human moderators. If we receive a report or complaint about any Formula(s) that you have published, we will retain any personal information shared with us in connection with that report or complaint for as long as we need to review, adjudicate, and resolve the case, or as otherwise required by law.

We may also use information about you to find and address violations of our Terms of Service or Content Policies; investigate suspicious activity; detect, prevent, and combat harmful or unlawful behavior; and otherwise maintain the integrity of our Service.

## Information We Share

We use third parties to provide the Service to you, and have contracted with these companies requiring them to protect your information (Third-Party Services):
