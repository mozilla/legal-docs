# Formulaic Privacy Notice

Last Updated July 3, 2024
{: datetime="2024-07-03" }

This privacy notice applies to Formulaic, a service that allows users to query, create, share, and manage templates for querying artificial intelligence (AI) based large language models (LLMs) (the “Service”). The Service is owned, licensed, and operated by Mozilla Corporation (referred to herein as “we,” “us,” “our,” or “Mozilla”).  

This privacy notice explains what information Formulaic collects, shares, and processes, and why. We also adhere to the [Mozilla Privacy Policy](https://www.mozilla.org/privacy/) when we receive, handle, and share personal information. Your use of the Service constitutes your acceptance of this privacy notice, which incorporates by reference our Terms of Service.

## Things you should know

We collect the following information directly from you when you use the Service:

**Username.** This is a unique, public-facing account name chosen by you. Any content that you choose to publish on the Formulaic website or otherwise contribute to the Service will include this username. We use this username to attribute you with any content you contribute or publish when using the Service, as well as to enforce our Content Policies.

**Account information.** We may collect personal information, such as your name, username, contact information, and any other information that you provide to us in connection with the creation or administration of your account.

**Formulas, Inputs and Outputs.** There are currently no LLM or similar AI-based platforms operated by or affiliated with Mozilla. However, the Service allows you to query selected LLMs offered by third parties (“Third-Party Models”) by inputting information into templates (“Formulas”) made available by the Service, as well as any Formulas that you yourself may choose to create and/or contribute to the Service. We process the content of your queries, as well as any amendments or updates you make to them, and any other content (including any media) you choose to upload to the Service (“Inputs”) in order to run them through Third-Party Models and generate results (“Outputs”). We also store Inputs and Outputs in your account, and you can choose to export your Outputs to your computer. 

**Documents.** The Service allows you to upload documents that you can then run queries against using the Third-Party Models to create your own Formulas which you can also share with others via a direct link. You can also run queries on the documents using template Formulas. We will retain a copy of your document until you delete it. Deleting the document from a Formula does not delete your full Formula history. To delete not only the document, but your histories, you need to delete the Formula containing the document via your settings. After deletion in either instance, the document will no longer be available to any other users you have previously shared the Formula with.

**Dashboard.** The Service also allows you to save your favorite Formulas, draft Formulas, and any published Formulas that you yourself may contribute via a non-public dashboard. We use any data that you provide via the Dashboard to deliver and improve your experience of the Service.

**Reports of violations.** The Service allows you to report suspected violations of our Terms of Service and Content Policies, which are in turn reviewed by human moderators. If you contact us to Report a Violation, we will retain any personal information you may share with us for as long as we need to review, adjudicate, and resolve the case, or as otherwise required by law.

**Communications.** When you contact us in connection with the Service, we may also collect personal information, such as your username, name, email address, or phone number, as well as any other personal information you may provide to us.

We also *automatically* receive certain information when you interact with the Service:

**Technical data.** We receive basic telemetry data by default, which we use to improve the performance, stability, and security of the Service, including information about your device, including hardware configuration and device operating system; browser information, such as browser type and settings; log files and usage data; and event information, such as errors or crashes. We may also receive additional information about your device, such as country, language, operator and OEM, which we use to prevent fraud and abuse, enforce our terms, and improve the security of the Service.

**Location data.** Your IP address is temporarily collected as part of our server logs, and automatically deleted after 30 days. We use it to approximate your location to comply with relevant legal and regulatory requirements, as well as for fraud and abuse prevention purposes.

**Interaction data.** We receive aggregate data about visits to the Formulaic website and other aggregate insights about user interactions with the Service. We use this data to better understand usage of the Service, as well as to add, improve, or remove certain features of the Service. We may also receive HTTP referral data to understand the website or domain that referred you to our site, which we only use for purposes of addressing bugs or other technical issues with our Service. We automatically delete this data after 30 days.

**Metrics.** We may also use cookies, device information, and IP addresses, along with clear GIFs, cookies, and third party services to securely operate the Service, help us understand how users engage with our Service, such as visits to our site and settings preferences, and provide additional functionality. We use:

- Sign in with Google, which places a cookie on your device to assist with sign-in and authentication to the Service. When you sign in to the Service, you accept the associated [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and [Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms) from Google.
- Google Analytics to obtain metrics on how users engage with our websites. This helps us to improve site content. For more information about how Google uses your personal information, please visit [Google Analytics’ Privacy & Security](support.google.com/analytics/topic/2919631?ref_topic=1008008). You can install the [Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) to prevent data collection about your visits to the Service and prohibit data transmission to Google Analytics.

We also receive the following *information from third parties* when you use the Service:

**Account data.** You need a Google Account in order to create an account and access the Service. When you log in with your Google Account to access the Service, we receive your name, email address, language preference, and profile picture from Google, and use this information to assist with your account administration and to contact you in relation to the Service, as well as to enforce our Terms of Service and Content Policies. Use of a Google Account is governed by [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and [Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms).

**Fraud Prevention.** We use third-party technology, Google’s Invisible reCAPTCHA, in the background of our website in order to identify fraudulent activity. Use of the Invisible reCAPTCHA is governed by Google's [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and [Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms).

**Model query data.** When you use the Service to query Third-Party Models, we automatically receive a payload back that contains the contents of your query; information about the model queried (such as the name and version number); information about technical problems with processing the query, if any; the number of tokens required to process the query; and the model Outputs in response to the query. We do not store this data beyond temporarily caching it to process your query and return the Outputs to you.

**Reports of violations.** The Service also allows users to report suspected violations of our Content Policies, which are reviewed by human moderators. If we receive a report or complaint about any Formula(s) that you have published, we will retain any personal information shared with us in connection with that report or complaint for as long as we need to review, adjudicate, and resolve the case, or as otherwise required by law.

We may also use information about you to find and address violations of our Terms of Service or Content Policies; investigate suspicious activity; detect, prevent, and combat harmful or unlawful behavior; and otherwise maintain the integrity of our Service.

## Information We Share

We use third parties to provide the Service to you, and have contracted with these companies requiring them to protect your information (Third-Party Services):

**Google Cloud Provider.** Google Cloud Provider (GCP) is a cloud-computing platform. We use GCP to facilitate account creation, authenticate users, host content, and provide access to certain Third-Party Models available through the [Google Vertex](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/overview) service.

**Anyscale.** Anyscale is a cloud provider that offers scaled hosting and inference of open source LLMs. We use Anyscale to provide access to certain open source Third-Party Models via our Service.

**OpenAI.** OpenAI is an AI research and deployment company that offers certain LLMs for individual and enterprise use, APIs, and other services. We use OpenAI to provide access to certain Third-Party Models, including ChatGPT, via our Service.

Third-Party Services, including any Outputs generated by the use of Third-Party Services and Third-Party Models, are subject to their own terms, and we are not responsible for them.
