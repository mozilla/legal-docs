# Firefox Private Network Browser Extension (Beta) Terms of Service

Version 3.0, effective July 7, 2020
{: datetime="2020-07-07" }

Firefox Private Network (“Service”) is an experimental offering. Please read these Terms of Service carefully because they explain important information about your use of the Service.

If you activate this Service, it keeps your Firefox web traffic private from your internet service provider, and most websites you visit by encrypting and routing it through our partner’s networks instead. It will also replace your actual IP address to keep your personal IP address private from others, such as the websites you visit and your internet service provider.

## You Must Be Eligible to Use the Service

You must be in the United States to download and use the Service.

A Firefox Account is required to use the Service. To create a Firefox Account, you will also need to agree to the [Terms of Service](https://www.mozilla.org/about/legal/terms/services/) and [Privacy Notice](https://www.mozilla.org/privacy/firefox/) for your Firefox Account.

## Your Privacy

__Your Privacy.__ The [Firefox Private Network Privacy Notice](https://www.mozilla.org/privacy/firefox-private-network/) explains what information is sent when you use the Service and how we handle and share that information.

Mozilla is a global organization, and our computers and service providers’ computers may be in various countries around the world, including the United States. This means that your information might be processed on servers located outside of the country where you live, and that country may have a different level of data protection regulation than yours. By giving us information, you consent to this kind of transfer of your information.

__30-Day Refund Policy.__ The first time you subscribe to the Service, if you cancel your account within the first 30 days, you may request a refund and Mozilla will refund your first month subscription. This offer only applies the first time you subscribe. This is in addition to any rights you may have under your country’s consumer laws.

## You May Cancel Your Subscription at any Time

You may cancel your subscription to Firefox Private Network at any time by deactivating your account and cancelling your subscription. You can do this by clicking the “Cancel Subscription” link in any email that we send you or by going to the [Subscriptions & Payments](https://subscriptions.firefox.com) Section of your Firefox Account and clicking “Cancel.”

* You assure Mozilla that you will not use the Service to infringe anyone’s rights or violate any law.

* To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree that Mozilla will not be liable in any way for any inability to use the Service, for any limitations of the Service, or for any claim arising out of these terms.

* You may have other rights under your own country’s laws. Nothing in these Terms of Service is intended to affect those rights, if they apply.

## Mozilla Can Update or End These Terms

* __Mozilla Can Update These Terms.__ Every once in a while, Mozilla may decide to update these Terms. We will post the updated Terms online and, if the changes are material, we will email the updated Terms to the primary email associated with your Firefox Account. We will post an effective date at the top of this page to make it clear when we made our most recent update. If you do not agree to the updated Terms, you may  cancel your subscription within 30 days. Your continued use of the Service after 30 days will be acceptance of the changes.

* __Termination.__ These Terms apply until either you or Mozilla decide to end them. You can choose to end them at any time for any reason by stopping your use of the Service and cancelling your subscription. Mozilla can suspend or end anyone’s access to the Service at any time for any reason, including if Mozilla decides to end the Service. If we decide to suspend or end your access, we will try to notify you at the email address associated with your account or the next time you attempt to access your Account.

  If we terminate your access to the Service without specific cause, you will continue to have access to the Service for the current billing period or we will refund the current month. However, we reserve the right to terminate your use of the Service immediately if we reasonably believe you have violated the Conditions of Use, have used fraudulent payment, such as the use of a stolen payment card, or have otherwise violated these Terms.

* __Choice of Law.__ California law applies to this contract, except for California’s conflict of law. If there is any conflict between this English version of the contract and a translation, this English version applies.
