# Mozilla VPN Terms of Service

Version 3.3, effective December 23, 2021
{: datetime="2021-12-23" }

Mozilla VPN (“Service”) is a Virtual Private Network in partnership with [Mullvad](https://mullvad.net). Please read these Terms of Service carefully because they explain important information about your use of the Service.

If you activate this Service, it keeps your internet traffic private from your internet service provider and most websites you visit by encrypting and routing it through our partner’s networks instead. It will also replace your actual IP address to keep your personal IP address private from others, such as the websites you visit and your internet service provider.

## You Must Be Eligible to Use the Service

You must be in a country where the Service is available to download Mozilla VPN and use the Service. Currently, the Service is available in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Austria, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Ireland, Malaysia, New Zealand, and Singapore. A Firefox Account is required to use the Service.

To create a Firefox Account, you will also need to agree to the [Terms of Service](https://www.mozilla.org/about/legal/terms/services/) and [Privacy Notice](https://www.mozilla.org/privacy/firefox/) for your Firefox Account.

## Your Privacy

__Your Privacy.__ The [Mozilla VPN Privacy Notice](https://www.mozilla.org/privacy/mozilla-vpn/) explains what information is sent when you use the Service and how we handle and share that information.

Mozilla is a global organization, and our computers and service providers’ computers may be in various countries around the world, including the United States. This means that your information might be processed on servers located outside of the country where you live, and that country may have a different level of data protection regulation than yours. By giving us information, you consent to this kind of transfer of your information.

__Purchasing through Apple or Google App Stores.__ If you purchased your subscription through in-app purchase from the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store, your payment is subject to the terms and conditions of the App Store. You must direct any billing and refund inquiries for such purchases to Apple or Google, as appropriate.

## You Are Responsible For the Consequences of Your Use of the Service

* You assure Mozilla that you will not use the Service to infringe anyone’s rights or violate any law.

* To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree that Mozilla will not be liable in any way for any inability to use the Service, for any limitations of the Service, or for any claim arising out of these Terms. Mozilla specifically disclaims the following: Indirect, special, incidental, consequential, or exemplary damages, direct or indirect damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, lost profits, loss of data, or computer malfunction. Any liability for Mozilla under this agreement is limited to $500.

* You agree to indemnify and hold Mozilla harmless for any liability or claim that comes from your participation in Firefox Accounts, to the extent permitted by applicable law.

* Mozilla provides the service “as is.” To the extent permitted by applicable law, Mozilla specifically disclaims any legal guarantees or warranties such as “merchantability,” “fitness for a particular purpose,” “non-infringement,” and warranties arising out of a course of dealing, usage, or trade.

* You may have other rights under your own country’s laws. Nothing in these Terms of Service is intended to affect those rights, if they apply.

## Mozilla Can Update or End These Terms

* __Mozilla Can Update These Terms.__ Every once in a while, Mozilla may decide to update these Terms. We will post the updated Terms online and, if the changes are material, we will email the updated Terms to the primary email associated with your Firefox Account. We will post an effective date at the top of this page to make it clear when we made our most recent update. If you do not agree to the updated Terms, you may cancel your subscription within 30 days. Your continued use of the Service after 30 days will be acceptance of the changes.

* __Termination.__ These Terms apply until either you or Mozilla decide to end them. You can choose to end them at any time for any reason by stopping your use of the Service and cancelling your subscription. Mozilla can suspend or end anyone’s access to the Service at any time for any reason, including if Mozilla decides to end the Service. If we decide to suspend or end your access, we will try to notify you at the email address associated with your account or the next time you attempt to access your account.

  If we terminate your access to the Service without specific cause, you will continue to have access to the Service for the current billing period or we will refund the current term. However, we reserve the right to terminate your use of the Service immediately if we reasonably believe you have violated the Conditions of Use, have used fraudulent payment, such as the use of a stolen payment card, or have otherwise violated these Terms.
