### What happens if you receive a DMCA Notification?

If you believe your content was removed in error, you can file a counter notification with the information below (“**DMCA Counter Notification**”).

Note: You can be held liable for damages, including costs and attorney fees, if certain material misrepresentations are contained in your DMCA Counter Notification. Consult an attorney before filing a DMCA Counter Notification if you are unsure if your material was removed in error.

Mozilla has a policy of terminating repeat infringers. If your account receives multiple copyright complaints, we may terminate your account.

### How do you file a DMCA Counter Notification?

Your DMCA Counter Notification must include all of the following information:

1. Your physical or electronic signature;
2. Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled (the description from the DMCA Notice is acceptable);
3. A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled;
4. Your name, address, and telephone number; and
5. A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your address is located, or if your address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which Mozilla may be found, and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA Notice or an agent of such person.

### What happens after sending the DMCA Counter Notification?

Upon receipt of a valid Counter Notification, we will promptly forward a copy to the person who filed the original DMCA Notice. If we do not receive notice within 10 business days that the person who submitted the DMCA Notice is seeking a court order to prevent the infringement of the content at issue, we will replace or re-enable access to the content that was removed.
