Mozilla has a policy of terminating repeat infringers. If your account receives multiple copyright complaints, we may terminate your account.

### How do you file a DMCA Counter Notification?

Your DMCA Counter Notification must include all of the following information:

1. Your physical or electronic signature;
2. Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled (the description from the DMCA Notice is acceptable);

### What happens after sending the DMCA Counter Notification?

Upon receipt of a valid Counter Notification, we will promptly forward a copy to the person who filed the original DMCA Notice. If we do not receive notice within 10 business days that the person who submitted the DMCA Notice is seeking a court order to prevent the infringement of the content at issue, we will replace or re-enable access to the content that was removed.
