# Mozilla’s Ad-Targeting Guidelines

Mozilla keeps privacy in mind when we conduct our marketing. We apply the following guidelines to our marketing efforts.

### Prohibited Targeting Tactics:

Agencies conducting work for Mozilla must avoid targeting tactics that utilize specific styles of 1st-party and 3rd-party data that may infringe on a user’s personal experience online. Those tactics include the following:

* No Site Retargeting - Site Retargeting is a tactic utilized by advertisers in which users are anonymously cookied after visiting an advertiser’s website. When the user leaves that website, they are “retargeted” meaning the user is exposed to additional ads from that same advertiser as they surf the web.
* No Impression Retargeting - Impression Retargeting is a tactic utilized by advertisers in which users are anonymously cookied after being exposed to a brand message from that advertiser. After the user is exposed to the initial ad, they are “retargeted” meaning the user is exposed to additional ads from that same advertiser as they surf the web.
* No Cross-Device Targeting - An advertiser is able to target the same user across multiple devices. For example, when a user is on their laptop, sees an advertisement, then goes to their tablet later on, and sees the same vendor ad, that vendor could be utilizing cross-device targeting to target the user.
* No Using Mozilla 1st-party Data to Build Look-A-Like Targets - Many publishers and partners offer look-a-like (LAL) targeting that requires an upload of 1st-party data to build those audience targets. We prohibit the use or sharing of our 1st-party data outside of our opted-in owned channels (email, for example).


### Approved Targeting Tactics:

The following are approved targeting tactics for all marketing, advertising and promotional Services that Agency may provide under applicable Statements of Work.  Agency will not engage in any advertising/targeting tactics that are not expressly set forth below, unless Agency receives Client’s prior written approval before engaging in any such additional advertising/targeting. 

* Contextual Targeting (Content Themes/Site Themes & Keyword Targeting) - Contextual targeting identifies content themes on pages across the web and allows a brand to align messaging/advertisements with specific content across the web to increase response. For example, reading a fitness website and being advertised a wearable fitness device
* Device Targeting - Device targeting gives advertisers the ability to target by desktop, mobile, or tablet device. For example, your laptop computer vs your cell phone. Desktop, Mobile, and Tablet are all approved devices for the Mozilla campaign.
* OS targeting - OS targeting allows advertisers to serve ads based on the operating system. For example, Windows vs Apple. Android only is the approved targeting OS version for targeting on mobile.
* Geographic Targeting - Allows targeting by country, region, and in some cases zip-level. For example, US only. US only is the approved targeting tactic for the campaign.
* Daypart Targeting - Tailoring advertisements to show only certain times of day. For example, daily 8am-8pm.
* Browser & Browser Version Targeting - Targeting segmented by only showing ads to users on a specific browser or browser version. For example, IE v 6.0.
* Demographic / Audience targeting  - Targeting an audience based on demographic profiles based on the vendor site or network’s 1st party data. For example, if a user has already signed up for a Yahoo account where the user has agreed to the terms of use, the use of Yahoo’s 1st or 3rd-party data is acceptable.
