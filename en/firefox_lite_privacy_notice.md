## At Mozilla, we believe that privacy is fundamental to a healthy internet.

That’s why we build Firefox Lite, and all our products, to give you greater control over the information you share online and the information you share with us. We strive to collect only what we need to improve Firefox Lite for everyone.

In this Privacy Notice, we explain what data Firefox Lite receives and shares and point you to settings to control this sharing. We also adhere to the practices outlined in the Mozilla [privacy policy](https://www.mozilla.org/privacy/) for how we receive, handle and share information we collect from Firefox Lite.

## Firefox Lite by default shares data to:

### IMPROVE PERFORMANCE AND STABILITY FOR USERS EVERYWHERE

* __Interaction data__: Firefox Lite sends data about your interactions with Firefox Lite to us (such as number of webpages visited, session length, and settings changes.) as well as  Firefox Lite features offered by Mozilla or our partners (such as interaction with Firefox Lite search features and search partner referrals).

* __Technical data__: Firefox Lite sends data about your Firefox Lite version and language; device operating system and hardware configuration; memory, basic information about crashes and errors; outcome of automated processes like updates, and activation to us. When Firefox Lite sends data to us, your IP address is temporarily collected as part of our server logs.

### SUGGEST RELEVANT CONTENT

Firefox Lite displays content, such as Top Sites (websites suggested by Mozilla for first-time Firefox Lite users) and Content & Services (non-personalized News, Shopping, Games, and More).

* __Technical & Interaction data__: Firefox Lite sends us data such as the position, size and placement of both the Top Sites and Content & Services content we suggest, as well as basic data about your interactions with the suggested content. This includes the number of times suggested content is displayed or clicked and time spent engaging with suggestions. 

* __Content & Services__: The Firefox Lite Content & Services  is localized news, games, deals and more offered by our partners in certain countries. In some cases, when you click on suggested content, we will notify the third-party content owner their content was found on Firefox Lite, but not who found it. This includes content from YouTube. You can read the YouTube [Terms](https://www.youtube.com/t/terms) and [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) for more information. See [here](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/firefox-lite-content-and-services) for more details.

* __Content data__: Some partners of suggested content send us aggregate metrics on the types of content people engage with, for example, shopping, sports or news, but Mozilla does not receive the identity of individuals who engage with the content.

### MEASURE AND SUPPORT OUR MARKETING

* __Referral and Campaign Data__: To help improve our marketing campaigns, Firefox Lite may use “Referral Data” such as the website domain or advertising campaign that referred you to download and install Firefox Lite. This data is kept by our analytics vendor, Adjust,and provided when you start Firefox Lite, and also includes a Google advertising ID, timestamp, country, locale, operating system, and app version. We may also use third party vendors to manage referral programs and handle any data that you choose to submit.

* __Reward Challenges__: A Firefox Account is required to participate in Reward Challenges. For more information, you can read the [Privacy Notice for Firefox Accounts](https://www.mozilla.org/privacy/firefox/#accounts). If you decide to participate in one of our reward challenges, Mozilla receives information about your interactions with the Firefox Lite features involved in the challenge. When you connect your Firefox Account, we will associate that reward challenge interaction  information with your Firefox Account. If you redeem your reward on our partner’s website, that partner will receive information about your purchases. We may receive aggregate data about what Firefox Lite users purchase on our third-party partners’ websites, but not what any specific individual purchased. We use this information to help inform and suggest relevant content to Firefox Lite users.

### LOCATION {: #location-services }

* __Location data to Google's geolocation service__: Firefox Lite always asks before determining and sharing your location with a requesting website (for example, if a map website needs your location to provide directions). To determine location, Firefox Lite may use your operating system’s geolocation features, Wi-fi networks, cell phone towers, or IP address, and may send this data to Google's geolocation service, which has its own [privacy policy](https://www.google.com/privacy/lsf.html).
