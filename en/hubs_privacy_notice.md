## Information We Collect and Share for Hubs Rooms

### Information Shared With Us and Other Participants
__Account information:__ You will need a Mozilla account to purchase a Hubs Subscription. However, a user does not need an account to use Hubs. Certain features (like storing your avatar), require an account. You can create an account through Hubs or through Discord. If you create an account with your email address, we store a hashed version of your email address. If you create an account through Discord, we receive the email address associated with your Discord account and your Discord avatar.

__Room names and URLs:__ Rooms and room names are publicly accessible to anyone with the URL. Mozilla stores the name and the URL for the link you share so you and others with the link to the Room can use it again.

__Avatar data:__ Your selected avatar and name will be shared with other participants in your rooms and the host of your Hubs instance. If you’re logged in to your account, we will store your avatar. If you’re not logged into your account, we will not store your avatar.

__Voice data:__ If your microphone is on, Hubs sends the audio to other users in the room. Mozilla does not store the audio; we only receive it temporarily to transmit it to others in the room.

__Chat:__ If you send messages in Hubs, Hubs shares it with the other users in the room. Mozilla does not store chats; we only receive it temporarily to transmit it to others in the room.

__Photos and Videos You Take, and Photos, Videos, and Objects You Upload:__ If you take photos and video in a Hubs room or upload photos, videos, or objects to a room, Mozilla stores them so you can share them within the room. They are deleted within 72 hours unless you pin them. If you pin them they will be stored until you remove them from the room and they will be viewable by anyone who can access the room.

You can learn more by looking at the code itself: [Hubs](https://github.com/mozilla/hubs) (the front-end) [Dialog](https://github.com/mozilla/dialog/) (the webRTC server), [Reticulum](https://github.com/mozilla/reticulum) (the backend web server), [Hubs-Ops](https://github.com/mozilla/hubs-ops) (the infrastructure code), [Discord Bot](https://github.com/MozillaReality/hubs-discord-bot) (enables users to connect their Discord community to Hubs).

### Other Information We Receive
We use technical, interaction, error, and website analytics data to help us improve the Hubs experiences:

__Technical data:__ We receive data about the type of devices used to interact with Hubs, as well as their operating systems, languages, the names and versions of browsers, and other data needed to load and operate a room. 

__Interaction data:__ We receive data about interactions with Hubs, such as the number of rooms created, messages sent through or to third-party services like Discord (including aggregated counts such as the number of messages and users who have joined relevant channels), the number of users in a particular room, the start and end time of users’ interactions with Hubs, the amount of time users interact with Hubs through virtual reality, the first time in a particular month or day that a user begins to use Hubs. 

__Error Data:__ When Hubs crashes or fails, Mozilla receives error messages which may include the room URL, response time for requests, the page a user was on when the error happened, the user’s operating system, browser information, and IP address.

__Website Analytics Data:__ We use Google Analytics (GA) to better understand how people interact with Hubs. For example, we collect de-identified information about the number of Hubs rooms created or entered, interactions with buttons and menus, session length, user location (country, state/province, and city), language settings, browser type and version, viewport size, and screen resolution. You can opt-out of GA data collection by installing the [Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

### Information We Collect for Published Scenes and Custom Avatars
__Scenes and avatars you create:__ Mozilla stores scenes and avatars that users create so we can display them.

__Attribution information:__ When someone publishes a scene or avatar to Hubs, they have the option to “Allow Remixing with Creative Commons [CC-BY 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/)” or “allow Mozilla to promote your scene or avatar”. If the user chooses one or both of these options, Mozilla will share the scene or avatar and attribution information publicly.

__Account information:__ To publish a scene or avatar to Hubs, a user must have a Hubs account. Mozilla will receive and store a hashed version of their email address to allow them to log in and view their 3D Room models and Avatars.

## Information We Collect about Your Subscription
__Mozilla account information.__ A Hubs subscription requires a Mozilla account, which sends Mozilla your email address, locale, and IP address. Learn more about [Mozilla account data practices](https://www.mozilla.org/privacy/firefox/#firefox-accounts-join-firefox).

__Location information.__ Mozilla receives your IP address from your Mozilla account when you sign up for and use the service. We use the IP address in order to approximate your location because Mozilla VPN is currently only available in certain countries.

__Payment information.__ When you subscribe to the Services, you will send payment through one of our third-party payment providers: Stripe, Apple, PayPal, or Google Pay. Mozilla receives a record of your account (including your billing address and the last four digits of your payment method) and the status of your account’s subscription, but does not store your full payment details. The payment providers may also collect personal transactional data or device information via cookies and similar technologies to operate and improve their service. You can learn more about how these companies use and process your data by reviewing their Privacy Notices, which are available on each of their respective websites.

__Usage information.__ We receive information about the rooms and users in your Hubs instance. For instance, we learn when you create and delete rooms, how many rooms are in your Hubs instance, and how many users are in each room. We also receive information about how much storage space your Hubs instance is using. 

## Who Hubs May Disclose Information To
__The Hubs Host:__ When you use a Hubs instance, Mozilla shares information with the Hubs subscriber who created the Hubs instance. This includes your username, information about your account and when you created it, as well as scenes, avatars, and other content you add to a Hubs room.  

__Amazon Web Services (AWS):__ Hubs use Amazon’s cloud storage service to store the information collected through Hubs. You can read [AWS’s Privacy Notice](https://aws.amazon.com/privacy/) for more information.

__Google Cloud Platform (GCP):__ Hubs use Google’s cloud storage service to store the information collected through Hubs. You can read [GCP’s Privacy Notice](https://cloud.google.com/terms/cloud-privacy-notice) for more information.

__Search providers:__ You can search for images, GIFs, and 3D Models to share in Hubs. When you search, we will send your searches to supported third parties to fulfill the search. Mozilla does not store your search queries or the search results. We support the following providers:
* [Tenor](https://tenor.com/legal-privacy)
* [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/privacy)
* [YouTube](https://policies.google.com/privacy)
* [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/privacy-policy/)

__X (formerly Twitter):__ If you connect X to Hubs, you can tweet and share 2D images from Hubs rooms. Any content you tweet will be shared with X and published on the X platform. You can see [X’s Privacy Policy](https://twitter.com/privacy) for more information.

__Discord:__ If you connect Discord to Hubs, we store access tokens and the server and channel IDs that have been connected. We will synchronize chat messages, room changes, 2D and 3D objects you create, and whether you join or leave with the connected Discord channel. Hubs does not log any synchronized messages. You can see [Discord’s Privacy Policy](https://discordapp.com/privacy) for more information.
