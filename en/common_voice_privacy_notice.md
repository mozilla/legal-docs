# Common Voice Privacy Notice 

Effective November 4, 2024 {: datetime="2024-06-27" }

## Privacy

When Mozilla (that’s us), receives information from you, our [Mozilla Privacy Policy](https://www.mozilla.org/privacy) describes how we handle that information.

* **Demographic data.** You can optionally send us information such as your accent, age, and gender. This helps us and other researchers improve and create speech-to-text technology and tools.

* **Account data.** You do not need to create an account to use Common Voice. If you decide to create an account, you will need to create a Mozilla account [here](commonvoice.mozilla.org/mozaws.net/signin), and we receive your username and avatar, if you submit one. Your use of Mozilla accounts is governed by the [Mozilla Accounts Terms of Service](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/legal/terms/services/) and [Mozilla Accounts Privacy Notice](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/mozilla-accounts/). Your email address is associated with your demographic and interaction data but is not shared to the public. We display leaderboards showing the number of recordings users make. You have the option whether or not you wish to appear on the leaderboards. You can delete your account at any time and your username and email will be removed. You can delete your Mozilla aaccount at any time and your username and email will be removed.

* **Email.** If you participate in the Alpha or Beta testing for the Common Voice Spontaneous Speech project, you must provide your email address so that we can send you a link to log in to participate in the Common Voice Spontaneous Speech project. At any time, you may create a Mozilla account (as set forth above). If you do not create a Mozilla account upon completion of the Alpha or Beta testing, we will delete your email address within two weeks after the completion of each testing program. Certain types of participation in Beta testing (e.g. for ultra low resource languages) may not require an email login.

* **Newsletter.** You can subscribe to our newsletter, in which case we receive your email address. You can unsubscribe at any time and your email will be removed from the newsletter distribution list.

* **Voice Recordings.** Voice recordings, along with any optionally provided demographic data, may be available in the Common Voice databases for public consumption and use under a Creative Commons Zero License ([CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)).

* **Text.** If you submit written sentences, we may also make those available in the Common Voice databases for public consumption under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/), in accordance with all our samples. We will not associate these sentences with the demographic data you submit.

* **Interaction data.** We use Google Analytics to better understand how you interact with the Common Voice app or website. For example, we may use cookies to track de-identified information such as the number of voice samples you record or listen to, interactions with buttons and menus, and session length.

* **Technical data.** We use Google Analytics to better understand how you interact with the Common Voice app or website. For example, we may use cookies to track de-identified information such as the number of voice samples you record or listen to, interactions with buttons and menus, and session length. We also collect the URL and title of the Common Voice pages you visit. To consistently improve the Common Voice experience, we collect information about browser type and version, viewport size, and screen resolution. This allows us to understand how people interact with Common Voice so we can improve it. We also collect your location, and the language setting in your browser to make sure it looks right for you. If you’d prefer to opt out of Google Analytics data collection, you can install the [Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout), which stops data transmission to Google Analytics.
