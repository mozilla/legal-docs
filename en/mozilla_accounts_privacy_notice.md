## Things You Should Know

__Registration data.__ Mozilla receives your email address and a hash of your password when you sign up for a Mozilla account. You can choose to provide your age, as well as to include a display name or profile image. Your email address is sent to our email vendor, Braze, which has its own [privacy notice](https://www.braze.com/company/legal/privacy); we use Brazeâ€™s services to communicate with you.

__Location data.__ We use the IP address in order to approximate your location for fraud and abuse prevention purposes across our products. We will send you email alerts if we detect suspicious activity, such as account logins from other locations. 

__Interaction data.__ We receive data such as your visits to the [Mozilla accounts website](https://accounts.firefox.com/), dashboards and menu preferences, what products and services you use in connection with your Mozilla account, and your interactions with our emails and SMS messages. We use this to understand your use of our products and services so we can improve them, and to send you more useful Mozilla account tips and in-product messages. Learn more about the Interaction Data we collect in the [Glean Dictionary](https://dictionary.telemetry.mozilla.org/apps/accounts_frontend) and our [Data Documentation](https://docs.telemetry.mozilla.org/datasets/fxa).

__Technical data.__ To display which devices are synced to your Mozilla account and for security functionality, we store your device operating system, browser and version, timestamp, locale, and the same information for devices connected to your account. If you use your Mozilla account to log into other websites or services (such as Pocket or Mozilla VPN), we receive the timestamp of those log-ins.
