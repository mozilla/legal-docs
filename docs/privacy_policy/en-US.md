### Firefox Marketplace Privacy Policy
July 3, 2013

This is an edit.

We care about your privacy. When Mozilla (that's us) collects information about you from the Firefox Marketplace, our [privacy policy](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/) describes how we handle that information.

<u>Things you should know</u>

- Most of the apps on the Firefox Marketplace are not made by us and you should check their privacy policies before using them.
- Payments are processed by others (not Mozilla) and you should check the privacy policy of the applicable payment provider to understand their practices.
  - No financial information (such as credit card info that you have used to make purchases in the Firefox Marketplace) is collected, retained or used by Mozilla.
- The Firefox Marketplace uses cookies and other web technologies to provide its functionality (such as remembering you between sessions) and to help us understand how users use the service through aggregate analytics.
- The Marketplace may use your carrier and location data to customize your experience.
  - On Firefox OS devices, we use network information from your device to understand your country location and carrier network to customize your experience and offer special carrier content.
  - On all platforms, we may use your IP address to determine your country location to customize your experience.
- You don't have to log in to install a free app, but paid apps require login. We also help you maintain a history of your transactional activity (like which Apps you have purchased).
- You may elect to receive email from us and can unsubscribe from any email marketing communications you elected to receive.

### Mozilla Privacy Policy

Your privacy is an important factor that Mozilla (that's us) considers in the development of each of our products and services. We are committed to being transparent and open and want you to know how we receive information about you, and what we do with that information once we have it.

### What do we mean by "personal information?"

For us, "personal information" means information which identifies you, like your name or email address.

Any information that falls outside of this is "non-personal information."

If we store your personal information with information that is non-personal, we will consider the combination as personal information. If we remove all personal information from a set of data then the remaining is non-personal information.

### How do we learn information about you?

We learn information about you when:

- you give it to us directly (e.g., when you choose to send us crash reports from Firefox);
- we collect it automatically through our products and services (e.g., when we check whether your version of Firefox is up to date);
- someone else tells us information about you (e.g., Thunderbird works with your email providers to set up your account); or
- when we try and understand more about you based on information you've given to us (e.g., when we use your IP address to customize language for some of our services).

### What do we do with your information once we have it?

When you give us personal information, we will use it in the ways for which you've given us permission. Generally, we use your information to help us provide and improve our products and services for you.

### When do we share your information with others?

- When we have gotten your permission to share it.
- For processing or providing products and services to you, but only if those entities receiving your information are contractually obligated to handle the data in ways that are approved by Mozilla.
- When we are fulfilling our mission of [being open](http://www.mozilla.org/about/manifesto.html). We sometimes release information to make our products better and foster an open web, but when we do so, we will remove your personal information and try to disclose it in a way that minimizes the risk of you being re-identified.
- When the law requires it. We follow the law whenever we receive requests about you from a government or related to a lawsuit. We'll notify you when we're asked to hand over your personal information in this way unless we're legally prohibited from doing so. When we receive requests like this, we'll only release your personal information if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. Nothing in this policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party's request to disclose your information.
- When we believe it is necessary to prevent harm to you or someone else. We will only share your information in this way if we have a good faith belief that it is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of you, our other users, Mozilla or the public.
- If our organizational structure or status changes (if we undergo a restructuring, are acquired, or go bankrupt) we may pass your information to a successor or affiliate.

### How do we store and protect your personal information?

We are committed to protecting your personal information once we have it. We implement physical, business and technical security measures. Despite our efforts, if we learn of a security breach, we'll notify you so that you can take appropriate protective steps.

We also don't want your personal information for any longer than we need it, so we only keep it long enough to do what we collected it for. Once we don't need it, we take steps to destroy it unless we are required by law to keep it longer.

### What else do we want you know?

We're a global organization and our computers are in several different places around the world. We also use service providers whose computers may also be in various countries. This means that your information might end up on one of those computers in another country, and that country may have a different level of data protection regulation than yours. By giving us information, you consent to this kind of transfer of your information. No matter what country your information is in, we comply with applicable law and will also abide by the commitments we make in this privacy policy.

If you are under 13, we don't want your personal information, and you must not provide it to us. If you are a parent and believe that your child who is under 13 has provided us with personal information, please [contact us](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/policies/firefox-os/) to have your child's information removed.

### What if we change this policy?

We may need to change this policy and when we do, we'll notify you.
