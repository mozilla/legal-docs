# Firefox Lite Web-Based Information Services

Firefox Lite uses web-based information services (“Services”) to provide some of the features provided for your use with this binary version of Lite under the terms described below. 

1. Mozilla and its contributors, licensors and partners work to provide the most accurate and up-to-date Services. However, we cannot guarantee that this information is comprehensive and error-free. For example, the shopping information may list items that have changed or expired. 
2. Mozilla may discontinue or change the Services at its discretion.
3. You are welcome to use these Services with the accompanying version of Firefox Lite, and Mozilla grants you its rights to do so. Mozilla and its licensors reserve all other rights in the Services. These terms are not intended to limit any rights granted under open source licenses applicable to Firefox Lite and to corresponding source code versions of Firefox Lite.
4. The Services are provided “as-is.” Mozilla, its contributors, licensors, and distributors, disclaim all warranties, whether express or implied, including without limitation, warranties that the Services are merchantable and fit for your particular purposes. You bear the entire risk as to selecting the Services for your purposes and as to the quality and performance of the Services. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of implied warranties, so this disclaimer may not apply to you.
5. Except as required by law, Mozilla, its contributors, licensors, and distributors will not be liable for any indirect, special, incidental, consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages arising out of or in any way relating to the use of Firefox Lite and the Services. The collective liability under these terms will not exceed $500 (five hundred US dollars). Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to you.
6. Mozilla may update these terms as necessary from time to time. These terms may not be modified or canceled without Mozilla’s written agreement.
7. These terms are governed by the laws of the state of California, U.S.A., excluding its conflict of law provisions. If any portion of these terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. In the event of a conflict between a translated version of these terms and the English language version, the English language version shall control.
